      <h2>Critical Occupation List</h2>
      <p>This page provides you with information on the occupations which fall under the critical skills list. Formerly the Green Card employment permit, the Critical Skills Employment Permit generally covers highly skilled occupations. In order to qualify for a Critical Skills permit, an employee must be offered a minimum salary of €30,000 from an occupation in the Highly Skilled Eligible Occupations List or a minimum salary of €60,000 from an occupation not on the Ineligible Categories of Employment List. Employers are not required to complete a labour market test. Applications cost €1,000 with €900 of this returnable if unsuccessful.
      If successful, the non-EEA national will be issued with a Critical Skills Employment Permit for two years and may then request a support letter to apply for a Stamp 4.</p>
